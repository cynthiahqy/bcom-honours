# Strategic Games with Perfect Information

## Definition: Normal-form game

\begin{gather*}
\anglebrac{N, (A_i), (\succeq_i)} \text{ or } \anglebrac{N, (A_i), (u_i)}
\intertext{where $\succeq_i$ can be represented by utility function $u_i : A \rightarrow \Reals$}
\end{gather*}

Example 2-player strategic game:

\twoPtwotwogame{A}{B}{L}{R}{a_1,l_1}{a_2,r_1}{b_1,l_2}{b_2,r_2}

- Finite set of $N$ players (Finite game)
- For each player $i \in N$
     - $A_i$: non-empty set of actions
     - $\Delta A\i$: Space of proability measures over $A\i$
     - Preference relation $\succeq_i$ on $A = \times_{j \in N}A_j$
     - Complete, transitive, \TK{reflexive}, binary relation

For a finite game:

- $(x_i)_{i \in N}$ or $(x_i)$: *profile*
     - collection of game objects (e.g. actions, action spaces, preference relations..)
     - one object per player
- $(x_i)_{j \in N\\{i}}$ or $(x_{-i})$
     - list of all objects for all players except player $i$
- $(x_{-i},x_i)$
     - list $x_{-i}$, and element $x_i$, which form the profile $(x_i)$

Strategies and pay-offs:

\begin{align*}
   (a\i) &: \text{Pure Strategy Profile}
\\ u\i(a\i,a\noti) &: \text{payoff in PS outcome with profile strategy $(a\i$)}
\\ (\sig\i) &: \text{Mixed Strategy Profile (collection of mixed strategies, one for each player)}
\\ \sig\i &: \text{Element of of $\Delta A\i$}
\\ \sig\i(a\i) &: \text{Probability of player $a\i$ under $\sig\i$}
\\ \Pi_{i \in N} \sig\i(a\i)&: \text{Probability distribution over $\bm{A}$ incuded by profile of mixed strategy ($\sig\i$)}
\\ U\i(\sig\i) = \sum_{a \in A} Pr(a \vert (\sig\i)) u_i(a) &: \text{von Neumann-Morgenstern Utility}
\end{align*}

- Pure strategy $a\i$ is equivalent to $\sig\i : \sig\i(a\i) = 1$
- Extend to non-finite games using pdfs rather than discrete probabilities

<!-- - $(a\i)$: Pure Strategy Profile -->
<!-- - $\sig\i$: Element of of $\Delta A\i$ -->
<!-- - $\sig\i(a\i)$: Probability of player $a\i$ under $\sig\i$   -->
<!-- pure strategy $a\i$ is equivalent to $\sig\i : \sig\i(a\i) = 1$ -->
<!-- - $\Pi_{i \in N} \sig\i(a\i)$: Probability distribution over $\bm{A}$ incuded by profile of mixed strategy -->

## Dominance Solvability:

### Dominance and Strict Dominance Solvability

For ___ **dominated strategy** $a_i, \ \exists \ a'_i$ s.t.

 -----------  ----------------------------     ----      ------------------------- --------------------------
 PS Strictly  $u_i(a_i,a_{-i}$)                $<$       $u_i(a'_i,a_{-i})$        $\forall a_{-i} \in A_{-i}$
 MS Weakly    $U_i(\sig_i,\sig_{-i})$          $\leq$    $U_i(\sig'_i,\sig_{-i})$  $\forall a_{-i} \in A_{-i}$
              $U_i(\sig_i,\sig_{-i})$          $<$       $U_i(\sig'_i,\sig_{-i})$  for some $a_{-i} \in A_{-i}$
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For ___ **dominant strategy** $a_i, \forall a'_i \in A_i$

 -----------  ----------------------------     ----      ------------------------- --------------------------
 PS Strictly  $u_i(a_i,a_{-i}$)                $>$       $u_i(a'_i,a_{-i})$        $\forall a_{-i} \in A_{-i}$
 MS Weakly    $U_i(\sig_i,\sig_{-i})$          $\geq$    $U_i(\sig'_i,\sig_{-i})$  $\forall a_{-i} \in A_{-i}$
              $U_i(\sig_i,\sig_{-i})$          $>$       $U_i(\sig'_i,\sig_{-i})$  for some $a_{-i} \in A_{-i}$
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Playing a *strictly dominated* strategy is incompatible with rationality.
- A player can have at most one *dominant* startegy (strict or weak)
- If all players have *strictly dominant* strategies, the game is **strict dominance solvable**
- If no two pure strategies can be ranked by dominance, consider mixed strategies
       - EXAMPLE: \slideref{GT-L03-S4}

## Iterated Elimination of Strictly Dominated Strategies (IESDS)

### Solving for set of IESDS

- identify *strictly dominated* strategies, remove, repeat
- at least one strategy profile survives
- remaining strategies are possible eqlbm strategies

#### IESDS properities:
- However, IESDS may not yield unique eqlbm prediction (e.g. if all outcomes survive)
- Requires many levels of mutual knowledge of rationality

#### EXAMPLES:
- 2 player 3x3 game \slideref{GT-L02-S5-6}
- Cournot Duopoly \slideref{GT-L02-S7}

## Best-Response Correpsondence

\begin{align*}
\intertext{The best reponse correspondence for any $a\noti \in A\noti$:}
   B_i(a\noti) &= \underset{a\i \in A\i}{\arg\max} u\i(a\i,a\noti)
\\ B_i &: \text{identifies optimal strategy of $i$, when $i$ conjectures that other play list $a\noti$}
\\     &: \text{not necessarily a singleton set, therefore correspondence not function}
\intertext{The mixed strategy best reponse correspondence for any $i$ and $\sig\noti \in \Delta A\i$:}
   B_i(\sig\noti) &= \underset{\sig\i \in \Delta A\i}{\arg\max} U\i(a\i,a\noti)
\end{align*}

## Nash Equilibrium (NE)

### Definition

Profile $(a_i)$ or $(\sig\i)$ of $\normformgame$ is:

 -------  ---------------------------------------------
 PSNE     $a\i \in B\i(a\noti) \quad \forall \ i \in N$
 MSNE     $\sig\i \in B\i(a\noti) \quad \forall \ i \in N$
 ------------------------------------------------------

In NE:

- Every player is best responding to the other players' actions
- No player has a profitable deviation, *given* the actions other the other players
- EXAMPLES: 2 player, 3x3 and 2x2 normal form games \slideref{GT-L02-S12}
\begin{align*}
\intertext{Support of $\sig\i$}
\intertext{If $(\sig\i)$ is a MSNE, then action $a\i \in A\i$ is in the support of $\sig\i$ if $\forall a'\i \in A_i$}
   \sig\i(a\i) > 0 &\LRA U\i(a\i,\sig\noti) \geq U\i(a'\i,\sig\noti)
\intertext{Therefore, if two actions $a\i, a'\i$ are in the support of $\sig\i$:}
   \sig\i(a\i) > 0 \text{ and } \sig\i(a'\i) >0 &\LRA U\i(a\i,\sig\noti) = U\i(a'\i,\sig\noti)
\end{align*}

### Computing Strategic Form NE

1. Identify BR's and PSNE
      a) any cell with all player's BR is a PSNE
2. Identify possible MSNE \TK{dominated or dominant}
      a) If there are no weakly *dominated* strategies, there are no MSNE where one player plays PS.
          i. Find mixed strategy of P1 that makes P2 indifferent between actions
          ii. Find mixed strategy of P2 that makes P1 indifferent between actions (therefore willing to play mixed strategy above)
      b) If there are weakly *dominated strategies*, there will be MSNE where one players plays PS
          i. Find mixed strategy that makes the pure strategy player willing to play the actions required to induce mixing from the other player

### NE Properties

- NE always survives IESDS
- However, IESDS outcomes not necessarily NE
- Possible to have multiple NE, or none in PS
- PSNE is also a MSNE

### NE Motivation

Difficult to motivate epistemically (see discussion in \suppref{O an FT} for PSNE, \suppref{OR} for MSNE)

- NE as learning outcome
     - Same players play same game repeatedl
     - In each new round, players' adjust strategy to a best response to other player's actions in last round
     - Adjustment stops at NE
     - However, require extensive learning, poor prediction of rare or one-shot strategic interactions \slideref{GT-L02-S16}
- \TK{NE as evolutionary-stable eqlbm}
- NE as a consequence of rationality
     - Each player *correctly* predicts how others will play, and best responds to that *correct* prediction (eqlbm action)
     - *correct* prediction comes from previous interactions with other players in population, or knowledge that other play is similarly rational, and will also known and best-respond to eqblm action
- MSNE as objects of choice
- MSNE as steady state
     - e.g. For 2 populations of players (buyers/sellers), MSNE gives the proportion of pop. that chooses certain actions
- MSNE as pure strategies with unobservables


## Nash's Theorem

***Every finite strategy game has a mixed-strategy equilibrium***

### Kakutani's Fixed Point Theorem

***A correspondence $C: X \ra 2^X$ has a fixed point if:***

1. $X$ is a non-empty, compact, and convex subset of $\Reals^n$, and
2. $C(x)$ is non-empty and convex for all $x$, and
3. $C$ has a closed graph

Explanation of KFPT \slideref{GT-L03-S10-11}

### Proof of Nash's theorem

Proof of Nash's Theorem using KFPT \slideref{GT-L03-S12-14}

### Glicksberg's Theorem

***Every game $\normformgame$ has a MSNE if:***

1. Each $A_i$ is a compact subset of $\Reals^n$
2. Each $u\i$ is continuous on $A$



# Knowledge

## States of the World

\begin{align*}
   \Om &: \text{space of mutually exclusive states of the world}
\\ \om \in \Om &: \text{a SoW encodes all information relevant to the game}
\end{align*}

## Information Sets

- Some information about a SoW is private or unknown, so some SoWs will be indistinguishable for certain agents
- Modelled using an ***Information partion*** $I(\cdot)$ of $\Om$: 
     - A collection of disjoint sets, whose union equals $\Om$
     - Each set element in the partion is an ***information set***
          \begin{align*}
             \{S_1,\dots S_2\} &: \text{is a partition of $S$ if $\forall i \neq j$}
          \\ S_i \cap S_j = \emptyset &\text{ and } \bigcup_{k=1}^n S_k = S
          \end{align*}
- If $\om' \in I(\om)$, then agent cannot distinguish between $\om, \om'$, since $\om \in I(\om')$

## Events and Knowledge of Events

- $E \subseteq \Om$: An event E is a weak subset of $\Om$
- If $\om \in E$: Event $E$ is true at $\om \in \Om$
- If $I(\om) \subseteq E$: an individual with the information partition $I(\cdot)$ knowns $E$ at $\om$
     - \TK{i.e. agent knows $E$ has occured, if all SoWs where E occurs are observationally equivalent in the same set.}
     - knows $E$ at $\om$ if all possible observationally equivalent SoWs in $I(\om)$ are in $E$
- $KE = {\om \in \Om : I(\om) \subseteq E}$: $KE$ is the event an agent knows and event $E$
- Interactive knowledge operators
     - $K_1$ is agent 1's knowledge operator, which depends on $I_1(\cdot)$

Card Game: \slideref{GT-L04-S12} 
     
### Properties of the Knowledge Operator

\TK{GT-L04-S13}
\begin{align*}
   KE \subseteq E &:
\\ KE \cap KE^c = \emptyset &:
\\ KE = KKE
\\ (KE)^c = K(KE)^c
\end{align*}

### Mutual and Common Knowledge

\begin{align*}
   w \in (MK)E &\equiv K_1 E \cap K_2 E \cap \dots K_n E 
\\ w \in (CK)E &\equiv \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty (MK)^n E
\end{align*}

### Example: The Electronic Mail Game: \slideref{GT-L05-S10-15}

\image{GT-L05-S12-ElectronicMail}{0.5}{}{h}

## Priors and Posteriors

**Prior Belief**: Belief held by an agent before she acquires any informatin (e.g. signal observation)
**Posterior Belief**: Belief an agent has after acquiring information

### Aumann's (1976) Agreement Theorem

**Theorem**:

- Suppose:
      - $\Om$ is finite
      - Agents 1 and 2 have the same *prior belief* on event E
      - P1's *posterior* assigns $\eta_1$ to event E
      - P2's *posterior belief* is $\eta_2$
- If P1 and P2's *posteriors* are common knowledge:
      - $\eta_1$ = $\eta2$
      
**Key Assumptions:**

- Common prior
- Common knowledge of rationality
- Bayesian updating
- Common knowledge of posteriors

#### Intuition

- If both P1 and P2 are rational, the only reason their beliefs differ are because of data differences
- As soon as the beliefs are revealed, then the have access to each other's information (as summarised in beliefs)
- Under *appropriate conditions*, their revised beliefs will necessarily be the same

#### No-Trade Theorems

Example: Equal bets for risk averse agents \slideref{GT-L05-S18}

# Epistemic Foundations of Solution Concepts 

## Correlated Equilibrium

### Definition

- Correlating Device $\corrdevice = \{\Om,(I\i),p\}$ 
      - $\Om$: finite state space
      - $I\i(\cdot)$: Information partition for each player
      - $p$: discrete probability function over $\Om$
- Strategy of player $i$ conditional on $\corrdevice$
      - $s\i : \Om \ra A\i$ s.t. $s\i(\om) = s\i(\om')$ whenever $I\i(\om) = I\i(\om')$
- Example:
\begin{align*}
   \Om = \{H,T\} &: \text{Heads or Tails}
\\ \{ \{H\} \{T\} \} &: \text{common information partition}
\\ p(H) = p(T) = 0.5 &: \text{probability function} 
\\ s\i(H) = s\i(T) &: \text{take same action for SoWs in same information set}
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\intertext{Correlated Equilibrium of $\normformgame$ consists of:}
   \corrdevice &: \text{correlating device}
\\ (s\i) &: \text{profile of strategies, conditional on $\corrdevice$}
\intertext{such that for each $i \in N$ and any $s'i$ of $i$ conditional on $\corrdevice$:}
   \sum_{\om \in \Om} p(\om) u\i (s\i(\om),s\noti(\om)) &\geq \sum_{\om \in \Om} p(\om) u\i (s'\i(\om),s\noti(\om))
\\ p(\om) &: \text{probability that SoW is $\om$}
\\ u\i(s\i(\om),s\noti(\om)) &: \text{utility of playing $s\i$ given $s\noti$}
\end{align*}

### Solving Correlated Equilibrium

\TK{A2, L24}

### Correlated Equilibrium Properties

- Every PSNE is a correlated eqlbm
      - correlating device could be anything, since PSNE is in BRs (regardless of state of world)
- For every MSNE of $\normformgame$
      - there exists a correlated eqlbm in which the induced probability distribution over outcomes ($p(\om\i,\om\noti)_{CE}$) is the same as in MSNE

### Revelation Principle for Correlated Equilibrium

\begin{align*}
\intertext{For $\Om = A$, finding all $p$ that solves the eqlbm condition, is the same as finding all possible probability distributions over outcomes obtainable in a correlated eqlbm}
   \sum_{\om \in \Om} p(\om) u\i (s\i(\om),s\noti(\om)) &\geq \sum_{\om \in \Om} p(\om) u\i (s'\i(\om),s\noti(\om))
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
    \Om &: \text{set of all possible combinations of actions, including nature's actions (i.e. $A = \times_{j \in N}A_j$)}
\\ I\i(\cdot) &: \text{agents know only the action they should play, other player's possible actions are in the same info set}
\\ p &: \text{restricted to ensure no player has incentive to deviate}
\end{align*}

## Rationalisability

### Definition

\TK{GT-L6-S10}
In a normal form game $\normformgame$, an action $a\i$ is ***rationalisable*** if:

- For each player $j$, there exists a set $Z_j \in A_j$ s.t.:
    
### Solving the set of Rationalisable Actions

1. Begin with full action set for each player $(A_i)$
2. Remove all actions that are never a BR, under *any* belief about opponents' action
     - *no rational player would never play these actions*
3. Remove all acitons that are never a BR to the *remaining* actions
     - *all players know other players are rational (and will not play step 2. actions)*
4. Repeat until no further actions are eliminated


### Rationalisability results

- Every player has at least one rationalisable pure strategy 
- Every NE is a rationalisable equilibrium
     - Any positive probability action in MSNE is rationalisable ($\sig\i(a\i) > 0 \LRA a\i \text{ rationalisable}$)
- Rationalisable strategies are a weak superset of IESDS strategies (IESDS $\subseteq$ Rationalisable)
     - In two player games: IESDS = Rationalisable

## Knowledge conditions

### Aumann & Brandenburger (1995)

 ---------------------   -----------------------------
 Structure of the game   players, strategies, payoffs
 Rationality             maximise (expected) payoff
 Belief                  about the strategy of another player
 -----------------------------------------------------------

## Evolutionarily State Strategies

\slideref{GT-L06-S23-}
Symmetric Two Player games:

- within species competition
- games are symmetric 
      - same strategy set $A_1 = A_2 = \{A,B\}$
      - symmetric payoffs $u_1(A,B) = u_2(B,A) = u(A,B)$
- payoffs measure fitness
- predict which strategy survive evoluntionary pressure

\begin{align*}
a &: \text{current strategy for all individuals (P1,P2)}
\\ b \neq a &: \text{strategy played by small $\eps$ mutant population}
\\ U_{reg} &= (1-\eps)u(a,a) + \eps u(a,b)
\\ U_{mut} &= (1-\eps)u(b,a) + \eps u(b,b)
\intertext{If $U_{reg} > U_{mut}$, for all $b$, and small enough $\eps$, the strategy $a$ prevails}
   U_{reg} > U_{mut} &: u(a,a) > u(b,a) \text{ or,}
\\                   &: u(a,a) > u(b,a) \text{ and } u(a,b) > u(b,b)
\intertext{If $U_{mut} > U_{reg}$, mutant population will take over, and $b$ will the surviving strategy}
\end{align*}

- $a$ is a best response to $a$
- $b$ is a BR to $a$
- playing $a$ against $b$ yields higher payoffs than $b$, stick with $a$

### Definition

An ***evolutionary stable strategy*** of a symmetric game is an action $a$ for which:

- $(a,a)$ is a NE, and
- $u(a,b) > u(b,b)$ for every BR $b$ to $a$, where $b \neq a$

# Static Games with Incomplete Information
\slideref{L07}
## Bayes Rule
\begin{align*}
   Pr(A \vert B) &= \frac{Pr(B \vert A) Pr(A)}{Pr(B)}
\\ Pr(B) &= Pr(B \vert A) Pr(A) + Pr(B \vert A^C)Pr(A^C)
\intertext{If A and B are independent}
   Pr(A \vert B) &= Pr(A)
\end{align*}

Example: Bayes Rule \slideref{GT-L07-S06}

## Definition: Static Bayesian game

\begin{align*}
\intertext{A Static Bayesian game consists of}
   N &: \text{finite set of players}
\\ \Om &: \text{finite set of SoWs}
\\ \Om = \Pi\i \Theta\i &: \text{all possible combinations of player types}
\\ A\i &: \text{set of actions for player $i$}
\\ \Theta\i &: \text{finite set of signals for each player $i$}
\\ \theta\i &: \text{element of $\Theta\i$, \textit{types}}
\\ \tau\i : \Om \ra \Theta\i &: \text{function that maps SoWs to signals}
\\ p\i \vert \theta\i &: \text{a belief of player $i$, conditional on signal $\theta\i \in \Theta$}
\\ u\i: A \times \Om \ra \Reals &: \text{utility function}
\intertext{Strategies:}
   s\i : \Theta\i \ra A\i &: \text{Pure strategy for player $i$}
\\ s\i : \Theta\i \ra \Delta A\i &: \text{Mixed strategy for player $i$}
\\ s\i(\theta\i) &: \text{strategy that player $i$ chooses if her type is $\theta\i$}
\end{align*}

## NE: Bayesian Games

### Pure Strategy Bayesian NE (PSBNE)

A profile of pure strategies $(s\i)$ is a PSBNE if for every player $i$, type $\theta\i \in \Theta$, and action $a\i in A\i$:
\begin{align*}
   \sum_{\om \in \tau\i^{-1}} (\theta\i) p\i (\om \vert \theta\i) u\i (s\i(\theta\i),s\noti(\tau\noti(\om));\om)
&\geq \sum_{\om \in \tau\i^{-1}} (\theta\i) p\i (\om \vert \theta\i) u\i (a\i,s\noti(\tau\noti(\om));\om)
\\ \tau\i^{-1}(\theta\i) &: \text{inverse function that maps signals to possible SoWs}
\end{align*}

### Example 1: Second Price Auction

\begin{align*}
   v\i &: \text{valuation that each player $i \in N$ attaches to auction item}

\\ \Theta\i = [0,1] &: \text{all possible types of player $i$}
\\ \Om = \Pi\i\Theta\i &: \text{all possible combinations of valuations}
\\ \tau\i(\om) = v\i &: \text{each player knows their own valuation}
\\ A\i = \Reals_{+} &: \text{players can bid any positive amount}
\\ \text{posterior belief} &: v\noti \vert v\i = U[0,1]^{\lvert N \rvert - 1}
\\ \text{utility} &: \text{if winning bid: valuation less payment, zero otherwise}
\end{align*}

- truthful bidding ($a\i = v\i$) is a Bayesian NE
- other NE include really high bids by one player, and zero by other players; no incentive to deviate

# Extensive Form Games with Perfect Information

\begin{align*}
\intertext{A finite extensive-form game with perfect information is denoted}

## PSNE: Finite extensive form games w perfect information

A strategy profile $(s\i)$ forms a NE of an extensive form game if for all strategies $s'\i$ of any player $i \in N$:
\begin{align*}
u\i(O(s\i,s\noti)) \geq u\i(O(s'\i,s\noti)) \quad \forall s'\i, \ i \in N
\end{align*}

### Computing Extensive Form NE: 

1. Express game in strategic normal form
2. Find NE of normal form game as usual

### NE and incredible threats

## Subgame Perfect Equilibrium (SPE)

### Definition: Subgames, and SPE

A strategy profile $(s\i)$ is an SPE of $\Gam$ if, $(s\i)$ induce a NE at every subgame $\Gam(h)$

\begin{align*}
\intertext{A subgame of $\Gam$ after the history $h$ is the game:}
\Gam(h) &= \anglebrac{N,H\vert_h,P\vert_h,u\i\vert_h}
\intertext{where}
   h' \in H\vert_h \LRA (h,h') \in H 
\\ P\vert_h(h') = P(h,h')
\\ u\i\vert_h(h') = u\i(h,h')
\end{align*}

### Computing SPE:
1. Backward induction
2. NE in each subgame
3. One-deviation property

\begin{align*}
   \Gam &: \text{finite-horizon extesnive game with perfect info}
\\ (s\i) &: \text{strategy profile}
\\ s'\i \in S\i : s'\i\vert_h \neq s\i\vert_h \cap s'\i\vert_{<h} = s\i\vert_{<h}
\intertext{$(s\i)$ is an SPE of $\Gam$ iff}
\nexists i \in N, \quad s'\i : u\i\vert_h(s'\i,s\noti) > u\i\vert_h(s\i,s\noti)
\end{align*}

\TK{1-D proof GT-L09-S07-08}

### SPE Results & Discussion

- Every SPE is an NE
- For $\Gam = \extenformgame$ with perfect information, there exists an SPE (proof via backward induction)

\slideref{GT-L10-S21}

- counterintuitive or counterfactual implications in some games (see SPE examples)

Bargaining game: 

- Unique SPE
    - implies no delay
    - SPE outcome is efficient
    - stationary strategies
    - implies a first-mover advantage
- Empirical validity
\slideref{GT-L11-S20-S21}

Epistemic foundations for SPE?
- backward induction requires common knowledge of rationality BUT also requires specifying strategies for histories that are never reached
    - what happens with histories reached only after strategic "mistakes", i.e. histories players with belief in common rationalit would not expect to find themselves at
    - Example: if P2 is called to play in centipede game, and believes P1 is irrational, how do we predict P2's strategies?
- [Basu (1988,1990), Binmore (1987,1996), Bonanno (1991), Reny (1992)]
    - CKR inconsistent with SPE, or incoherent in extensive games? 
- VS. Aumann (1995): 
    - CKR implies SPE for games with perfect information, no simultaneous moves, and no moves of nature
    - off-eqlbm nodes: never reached, so CKR only tells us what player *conjecture* about actions of other players off the eqlbm path
- VS. \TK{Rabin's Critique}:
    - SPE may also require knowledge of what NE will be played at simultaneous move stage

## Mixed Strategies in Extensive Form Games

- **Mixed strategy**: lottery over outcomes
- **Behavioural strategy**: collection of lotteries for player $i$ over $A(h)$, one for each $h : P(h) = i$
- **Profile of strategies**: induces lottery over terminal histories (outcomes)
     - ***Outcome equivalence***: two \TK{profiles} of mixed or behavioural strategies induce the same lottery over outcomes

EXAMPLE: Mixed vs. Behavioural strategies

\slideref{GT-L09-S10}

### Kuhn's Theorem: Outcome equivalence

In any extensive game $\Gam = \extenformgame$ of ***perfect recall**, mixed and behavioural strategies are ***outcome equivalent***.

- Every mixed strategy is outcome equivalent to the behavioural strategy is generates
- Every behavioural strategy is outcome equivalent to the mixed strategies which generated it.

Due to equivalence focus on *behavioural strategies*



# Perfect Information Extensive form with simultaneous moves

## Definition:

Same as Perfect Information Extensive Form games except:

\begin{align*}
   P : H \slash Z \ra N &: \text{ P(h) can be subset of N, not singleton}
\\ A\i(h) &: \text{ action set for $i \in P(h)$}
\end{align*}

\sideimages{GT-L09-S15}{GT-L09-S16}{Simultaneous moves as information sets}{}

## Subgames w/ non-singleton information sets

- subgames contain either whole information set or none of it
- can mean that SPE = NE

## Forward induction

### Informal: Expected actions/payoffs

- Player 1 will only choose inside option if it gives them a higher payoff than outside option
- If the inside option has 2 NE, the NE played must give P1 a payff of at least as good as outside option

### Formal: Iterated Elimination of Weakly Dominated Strategies

### Forward Induction Results: "Burn a dollar"

# Repeated Games: Infinite

## Definition: Infinitely repeated games

\suppref{Def 137.1 in OR}

$\Ginfty$ is the perfect information extensive form game where $G$ is repeated infinitely

\begin{align*}
   G = \normformgame &: \text{Finite Stage Game; NE existence is guaranteed}
\\ \Ginfty &: \text{Infinitely Repeated Game}
\intertext{Player Utility in $\Ginfty$}
   \text{stream of payoffs for player $i$ from infinite strategy} &: (w\i^0, w\i^1, \dots , w\i^t, \dots)
\\ \text{payoff of player $i$ a discounted sum} &: V\i = \sum_{t=0}^\infty \delta^t w\i^t
\intertext{For stream $w\i^t = c, \ \forall t$}
   V\i = \frac{c}{1-\delta} 
\intertext{If $c=(1-\delta)V\i$, player $i$ is indifferent between the streams $(c,\dots)$, and $(w^t,\dots)$}
   (1-\delta)V\i &: \text{discounted average of stream $(w^t,\dots)$}
\\ \delta\i = \delta &: \text{Assume ALL players have the same discount rate}
\end{align*}

### Assumption of infinite horizon

- Assuming a very long horizon vs. infinite horizon gives different results
     - unique NE for finite repetition (e.g. $PD^T$: play ($D,D$) in every stage)
     - but other NE exist for $PD^\infty$
- Infinite horizon is mathematical equivalent to assuming the game ends with probability $\delta$ after each stage
     - \TK{infinity of rounds is possible, but game ends in finite time with probability 1}
     - \suppref{OR p.135}

## Existence of NE and SPE

1. Glicksberg's theorem can be used to show $\Ginfty$ has an NE
2. Alternatively,  
Lemma: ***Any profile of strategies that induces the SAME NE of the stage game $G$, after every stage/history of $\Ginfty$ is a SPE of the latter.***   
All SPE are NE, therefore existence of NE follows

### One-Deviation Property

A strategy profile $(\sig\i)$ in a repeated game is an SPE iff:  
there is no player $i$, and strategy $\hat{\sig}\i$, which differs from $\sig\i$ only at history $h$ such that:  
$\hat{\sig}\i$ leads to a better outcome for $i$ conditional on $\sig\noti$, and $h$ being reached

## Example: Infinitely Repeated $PD^\infty$

\twoPtwotwogame{C}{D}{C}{D}{2,2}{0,3}{3,0}{1,1}

### Strategies:

- Always defect (AD)
- Grim Trigger (GT)
     - I play C until opponent plays D
     - Once opponent plays D, I play D for the rest of the game
     - Punish defection forever
- Modified Grim Trigger (GT*)
     - I play C until either I or my opponent plays D
     - Once anyone plays D, I player D for the remainder of the game
- Tit for Tat (T4T)
     - I start by playing C
     - Play whatever the opponent played in the previous round
     - Allows for protection against recalcitrant defectors, by also can renew cooperation 
     - Punish defection for single period 
- Limited punishment $k$ ($LP_k$) 
     - I start by playing C
     - Play D for $k$ periods after observing D
     - If opponent plays D during $k$, punishment is restarted
     - If opponents plays C, I play C after $k$ rounds of D

### Equilibrium Calculations
\slideref{GT-L13}

- (AD,AD) : SPE since (D,D) is NE of stage game
- \TK{GT is NE but not SPE}
- \TK{GT* is SPE}
- \TK{T4T is NE}
- \TK{T4T is SPE using 1-D property}

## Feasible Payoff Profiles

### Minmax Payoffs

\begin{align*}
\intertext{The minmax payoff of player $i$ in $G$ is the lowest payoff where $i,j$ are playing a BR}
   \minmaxv &= \underset{\sig\noti}{\min} (\underset{\sig\i}{\max} u\i(\sig\i,\sig\noti))
\\ \sig\i, \sig\noti &: \text{pure strategies}
\intertext{Even if others want to hurt $i$, as long as $i$ is best responding, they can get at least $\minmaxv$}
\\ \text{choose strategy to minimise player $i$'s maximum utility} &: \sig\noti^{*} \in \arg \min (\max_{\sig\i} u\i (\sig\i,\sig\noti))
\\ \text{let player $i$ choose their best reponse} &: \sig\i^{*} \in BR\i(\sig\noti^{*})
\\ \text{Then, for any $\sighat\noti, \sighat\i \in BR(\sighat\noti)$:} &: \minmaxv\i = u\i(\sigstar\i,\sigstar\noti) \leq u\i(\sighat\i,\sighat\noti)
\end{align*}

In $\Ginfty$

1. Fix strategy of other players
     - $s\noti \text{ in } \Ginfty$
2. Find BR of player $i$ after every history
     - $s\i \in BR(s\noti)$
3. In each period player $i$ receives at least $\minmaxv$ because they are best responding
     - $\minmaxv$: guaranteed discounted avg payoff
4. In any NE of $G^\infty$, any $i \in N$ receives discounted avg payoff of at least $\minmaxv$

### Individual Rationality

A payoff profile $(v_1,\dots,v_{\vertbrac{N}})$ with discounted average payoff $v\i$ is:

 --------------------------   ------------------------------------------
 Individually Rational (IR)   $v\i \geq \minmaxv \quad \forall i \in N$
 Strictly IR                  $v\i > \minmaxv \quad \forall i \in N$
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
### Feasibility

A payoff profile for $G$ is a **feasible** discounted avg payoff of $G\infty$ if it is in the (convex) polygon defined by the stage game's outcome payoffs. 
 
### Examples

#### $PD^\infty$

\twoPtwotwogame{C}{D}{C}{D}{2,2}{0,3}{3,0}{1,1}

- For $\delta$ close to 1, players can get any payoff profile that is a weighted average of outcomes payoffs of the stage game
- Any payoff profile in the *quadrilateral* defined by $(2,2), (0,3), (3,0), (1,1)$ is **feasible**

#### L14 examples

\image{GT-L14-S15}{1}{}{h}

## Folk Theorems

### $PD^\infty$: Nash and SPE Folk Theorems

(1) For any $\delta \in (0,1)$:

- $PD^\infty$ has an NE (and SPE), where $v\i = u\i(D,D)$
     - i.e. (Always D, Always D) is an NE, and SPE
- in any NE (and SPE) of $PD^\infty$, $v\i \geq u\i(D,D) = \minmaxv$
     - any player is able to guarantee themselves their minmax payoff (IR)
     - the minmax payoff is the NE of the stage game $PD$: $(D,D)$
  
(2) For any *feasible*, and **strictly** individually rational discounted average payoff profile ($v\i$)

- $\exists \ \bar{\delta} < 1$ such that $\forall \delta > \bar{\delta}$
- $PD^\infty(\delta)$ has an NE (and SPE), where the discounted avg payoff is $v\i$

#### PROOF SKETCH: Nash Folk Theorem

1. Fix $\delta$, and some feasible and strictly IR ($v_1,v_2$)
2. Consider a finite sequence of outcomes $(a^1,\dots,a^k)$, that if repeated infinitely would generate avg discounted payoffs equal to $(v_1,v_2)$
3. Define simple trigger strategies for both players
     - each player adheres to whatever strategy is requires to generate $(a^1,\dots,a^k)$
     - unless the other player $j$ deviates
     - then player $i$ plays $D$ from here on out
4. Show that if players are sufficiently patient
     - the small instantaneous benefit of deviation is outweighed by loss in utility stream
     - requires *strict* IR, so that $v\j > u\j(D,D)$ and punishment is "painful"
     - INTUITION: if $j$ cares enough about future, they prefer getting the higher discounted avg payoff $v\j > u\j(D,D)$ than deviating and receiving $u\j(D,D)$ forever after

For SPE: \slideref{GT-L14-23}

#### COMMENTS

Result

- If players are sufficiently patient, any feasible and strictly IR average payoff profile is the payoff of some NE
     - doesn't mean any outcome path is possible, since statement is about payoffs only
     - doesn't restrict strategies played either, could have multiple NE strategies generating the same payoffs
- same result holds for SPE

Limitations

- restricted predictions
- may require unrealisticly high levels of patience

### Nash Folk Theorem for Infinitely Repeated Games $\Ginfty$

(1) For any *feasible*, and **strictly** individually rational discounted average payoff profile ($v\i = (v_1,\dots,v_{\vertbrac{N}})$) in $\Ginfty$

- $\exists \ \bar{\delta} < 1$ such that $\forall \delta > \bar{\delta}$
- $G^\infty(\delta)$ has an NE (and SPE), where the discounted avg payoff is $v\i$

Proof: \slideref{GT-L15-S17-18}

Comments: 

- doesn't imply that non-strictly IR payoffs cannot occur (e.g. in $PD: (\minmaxv_1,\minmaxv_2)$ is NE)
- implies players can cooperate infinitely in NE
- however, players could do worse than the unique NE of the stage game

**Fundenberg & Maskin (1986)**

Let $(v_1,v_2)$ be a feasible, strictly IR discounted avg payoff profile of some **two-player** game $\Ginfty$.

There exists $\bar{\delta} < 1$ such that, for all $\delta > \bar{\delta}$

$\Ginfty(\delta)$ has an SPE, with discounted avg payoff for player $i$ of $v\i$

\slideref{GT-L15-S19}

# Extensive Form games w/ Imperfect Information

## Weak Sequential Equilibrium (WSE)

- refinement of NE for extensive form games
- in many games SPE has no bite above NE, so SPE could feature incredible threat

### Definition: Belief Systems

- At any information set with more than one possible history:
    - a rational bayesian agent must be best responded to some belief about the likelihood of the possible histories
- For simultanenous-move games, NE and SPE forces the beliefs to be correct (actual probability)
- In an extensive form game $\Gam = \extenformgame$, a **belief system** is:
    - a function that assigns to each information set, a probability distribution over the the histories in that information set
    - specifies all players' beliefs
$$\mu\i(\{I(\cdot)\})(h)$$

### Definition: Assessment

In an extensive form game, an **assessment** is a pair of:

- profile of behavioural strategies, one element for each player
- belief system, specifying all players' beliefs when $P(h) = i$

### Definition: Weak Sequential Equilibrium

- Equilibrium in a game with incomplete information consists of an *assessment* not just a *strategy profile*. 
- For finite extensive-form games with perfect recall, there always exists at least one WSE
- WSE is also known as: *assessment eqlbm*, *weak perfect Bayesian eqlbm*, *perfect Bayesian eqlbm*

\begin{align*}
\\ \B &: \text{behavioural strategy profile}
\\ \mu &: \text{belief system}
\end{align*}

An assessment $(\beta,\mu)$ is a weak sequential equilibrium if:

(1) **Sequential rationality**
     - Every player is best responding at every information set, given beliefs (for each information set), and holding constant the other players' strategies
     - For every information set $I\i$, of every player $i$:
     - For the probability distribution over terminal histories generated by $\mu\i(I)$, and behaviour prescribed by $\B\i$:
     - their expected payoff is at least as large as the expected payoff under any other behavioural strategy:
     - $EU((\B\i,\B\noti),\mu\i) \geq EU((\gam\i,\B\noti),\mu\i)$
(2) **Weak consistency of beliefs with strategies**
     - Each player's belief is consistent with the strategy profile, (i.e. beliefs are derived using Bayes' rule whenever possible)
     - For every information set $I\i$ reached with positive probability under $\B$:
     - The probabilities in the belief system $\mu$ are derived via Bayes' rule
     - No restriction on information sets not reached by $\B$

- Strictly Dominant strategy is the unique SR strategy
- strictly dominated strategies are never SR
- Dominance criterion: never put positive probability on other player's playing strictly dominated strategies; no reference to eqlbm
- Cho-Kreps: references eqlbm, beliefs, off eqlbm actions = incentive to deviate

### WSE are SPE and NE

- Games that are extensive form, perfect info, no-simultaneous moves have only one possible belief system: 
      - $\mu$ assigns probability 1 to the only histor at each information set
      - SR implies NE in the subgame after any h
      - WSE is SPE
- For general extensive games:
      - SR implies each player $i$'s strategy at the beginning of the game, given others' strategies, and $i$'s beliefs
      - Consistency implies that each player's beliefs are correct at every *reached* information set (on the eqblm path)
      - WSE is NE

### Computing WSE

(1) First Principles

1. Consider all possible strategy profiles
2. Check if there are consistent beliefs systems for these strategies
3. Together satisfy WSE conditions

(2) From NE

1. Find all NE, which may be WSE
2. Check for weakly consistent beliefs that can support NE as WSE

## WSE Refinement

### Dominance Criterion

A WSE satisfied the **dominance criterion** if:

- for all information sets, 
- the belief system $\mu$ places zero probability on
- histories which can only be reached if a player played a strictly dominated action.

## Signalling Games

\slideref{GT-L17}

- subclass of Extensive form games with incomplete information:
- player type is payoff-relevant
     - e.g. lazy/hardworking employee, smart/stupid etc.
     - **sender**: type $i$ is known to $i$, but not to other players
     - **receiver**: others make inferences based on type $i$'s strategic decisions, after receiving sender's signal
- Examples:
     - animals signalling "fitness", by investing in expensive highly visible attributes
     - firms signalling product quality with free samples, or generous return policies
     - high bids in poker, brinkmanship, price wars, relational gift exchange

### Definition: Pooling and Seperating Equilibria (PSWSE)

                  **Seperating**                        **Pooling**                      *Partially*
 ----------      --------------------------            --------------------------       ------------------------
 Sender           each type chooses different action    all types choose same action     more than 2 types
 Receiver         knows type perfectly                  action gives no information      actions give some information
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Example: Spence's model of education

#### Example: Beer or Quiche

### Defintion: Cho-Kreps Intuitive Critereon

1. Consider if either type would have an incentive to deviate if the other players' actions changed
2. Consider what belief would be required to change the other players' action
3. Can these form a profitable deviation for one type in eqlbm, and switch the eqlbm to a different pooling eqlbm

\TK{Is Cho-Kreps only for pooling eqlbm?}

### Reputation Games

- Also signalling games
- usually modelled via player types

\begin{align*}
   (1-p) &: \text{Pr(P1 is rational and strategic (S))}
\\ p     &: \text{Pr(P1 is committed to a certain strategy, regardless of events (NS))}
\\ \text{P2's prior} &: p
\\ \text{P2's posterior} &: \mu_2(\{S,NS\})(S) \in [0,1]
\end{align*}

#### Example: $PD^T$

- no discounting

T = 2
T = 3, $p > \frac{1}{2}$

Limiting Result for $PD^T$

- The number of period in which either P2, or P1(S) defects (D) on the eqlbm path in WSE is bounded by $M < T$, that depends on $p$, not $T$
- For given $p$, there exists some $\hat{T}$ such that for all $T > \hat{T}$, the players cooperate in all most all periods even if P1 is strategic
- Even with very small $p$, with a sufficiently large $T$, can achieve average per-period payoff arbitrarily close to $(2,2)$

Intuition:

- If P1(S) acts like P1(NS), then the mutually harmful path of (D,D) is avoided
- both players can opperate
- However, the incentives for P1(S) to act like P1(NS) diminish towards the end of the game

## Cheap talk Games

- Under signalling games
      - actions are differently costly to different types of senders
      - so actions are payoff relevant
      - it is possible for receiver to perfectly learn the sender's type (separating eqlbm)
- can play types be communicated with cost-less actions that don't affect payoffs?

### Defintion: Cheap Talk Games
- Sender chooses costless action: $m \in M$
     - assume $M$ is sufficiently rich to have as many messages as sender types
- message $m$ does not affect the payoff of either player
     - meaning of messages can also drift (e.g. Language inflation)
     - signals information, or intention
- assume communication is:
     - **unverifiable**: senders can not present evidence about their type
     - **non-binding**: actions of receiver, or sender are not limited
- does not allow for lying
     - incentives to lie are accounted for by others in eqlbm
     - obscuring the truth can occur (e.g. via pooling), but \TK{no deception} will take place

## Signalling Information
- Sender has perfect knowledge of the SoW
- Receiver does not know the SoW
- SoW affects payoffs of both players

### Definition: Babbling equilibria
- uninformative equilibria:
     - R ignores messages
     - S best responds by sending the same message regardless of SoW
     - R's choice to ignore is justified, because S's messages are uninformative
     
### Conditions for Informativeness

1. Different sender types need to have different preferences over the receiver's actions
2. The preferences of the sender and the reciever need to be partially aligned
3. The sender's information needs to be valuable to the receiver

#### Example: The Investment Game

## Pre-play Communication (Signalling Intent)

### Definition: Self-committing and self-signalling

$m_F$: Message with meaning "I intend to play F"

  Self-committing                           Self-signalling
 ---------------------------------         -----------------------------------
  If R believes $m_F$ sent by S,            S wants R to believe $m_F$ **iff**
  R has incentive to choose action F        S plans to play F
  $(F,BR(F))$ is NE                           $BR(F) \in \underset{X}{\arg\max} u_S(F,X)$
                                              $BR(F) \notin \underset{X}{\arg\max} u_S(G,X)$
